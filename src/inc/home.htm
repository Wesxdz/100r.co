<h3>Chapter Zero</h3>
<h3>The Anticradle</h3>

<p>Future Simulator's imperative was dispatched at the first evidence confirming a supervolcano eruption on Ice V.</p>
<p>SAFETY CRITICAL THREAT IMMINENT</p>
<p>Surface mission evacuation in T-13!</p>
<p>Brace for liftoff!</p>
<p>Heonae secured the firstborn into a cradleboard fit for ergonomic acceleration, then stabilized in her own robot in port.</p>
<p>Soa's thrusters tumbled into the calm sky.</p>
<p>Tsunday awakened, and began to cry.</p>
<p>"This was to be your home, children," Heonae hummed deep in nourished bones.</p>
<p>"The seeds of civilization sown between rumbling volcanoes and frozen oceans," Heonae was told by the foragers.</p>
<p>A single chance survivor of abandonment terror onboard... perhaps was even favored to succeed someday.</p>
<p>Queen Heonae sighed as the ship's optics streamed the electrons of her aquifer seas and the newtons of her magma peaks defiled in crust's cough.</p>
<p>Anticipated return trajectory: 120 years.</p>
<p>Abort cradle_program_0.</p>
<p>Abort cradle_program_1.</p>
<p>Future Simulator decreed infanticide with king's cryptography, and his robot knight would follow with the sword.</p>
<p>Why, only gynoid Heonae held root permissions on the fledgling nursery.</p>
<p>A two year old girl and an array of seven Fetus.</p>
<p>We cannot grow, nor our stores lose more than a decade of life to your siblings, Tsunday.</p>
<p>It was the only return, to cease cradle one's development.</p>
<p>Heonae killed the chrono-septuplets with umbilical_knife.</p>
<p>"Tsunday, listen most closely," Heonae whispered, "you will live and die an endling on Soa. You can contribute nothing to our mission. You will certainly reduce its likelihood of success. And I shall never tell you this."</p>
<p>"I will carry you to maturity. You genetic princess of a doll. You adorable oafish gamit. You die cast against all children of the future."</p>
