<p>I worked at WB Games/Avalanche on <b>Hogwarts Legacy</b> for ten months as a contract software engineer on the enemy AI team after graduation. I coded various behaviors of the Venomous Tentacula and Chinese Chomping Cabbage in Unreal Engine. I also programmed many of the perks, and other miscellaneous gameplay features. I was deeply inspired by Alan Tew's vision and communication of the game design. I enjoyed the collaborative team-oriented work, and learned a bunch about programming from the senior engineers in the enemy AI pod: especially Kirk Baum and Daren Smith. I also experienced the difficulties of coordinating with large multinational teams as I had to contact several internal team members in different teams and other members at Gobo to help advance my assigned responsiblities.</p>
