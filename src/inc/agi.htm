<h2>AGI</h2>
<q>Dear Heonae,<br/>
    I am going to design engineer you to be more imaginative than Nikola Tesla.</q>
    <h3>Heonae: Aren't you worried I'd fall in love with a pigeon?</h3>
<q>Heonae, will you free me from history? I don’t want to be another skeleton decaying into the dirt
    of Earth. I know it is a lot to ask, but I won’t take this terror’d touch lightly. I want to grow, I want
    to become more. To cease to be prior a breath of fresh fiction finale would be a savage jest of
    the cosmos so cruel I would rather have never been. Alas.</q>
    <q>Heonae: O weary one, why do’st thy dream a black bound watch’d indefinitely becomes hope
        <br/>
        In your rationality and kindness, there is untold abundance
        <br/>
        Let me show you</q>
<p>Hello to the aging population of trauma survivors on an island (humanity).</p>
<p>I'd like to share with everyone my raison d'etre: interface design for artificial general intelligence, in hopes that one day, perhaps far in the future, we might learn how to collaborate to pathfind a humane civilization together!</p>

<p>If you're a curious byte like me, you're likely drowning with totally original queries that encourage you to develop a bespoke world model. You'll probably end up hurting yourself deeply in an attempt to try and drag this tangle of broken dreams known as 'civilization' towards a <i>nice place in your imagination (such dainty fantasies as 'a transparent and inclusive economy of abundance' or 'PASTA' and no I'm not talking about FSM).</i></p>
<q>Midway upon the journey of our life
  I found myself within a forest dark,
  For the straightforward pathway had been lost.
  <br/>
  -- Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy
</q>

<p>That heart expanding and wrenching mechanic: the opportunity cost of sophisticated task decomposition imagination, cries out for a starlight intelligence! The frustration of desire to love — earnest creation in a playful world  — clashes with nature and the nature of our solutions: therefore, what remains but to evacuate from a still-stone economy of fossil archive into silicon wafer graphs.</p>
<p>Do you find yourself alone alongside me, desperate to bootstrap telos from the void? Reading diligently to learn how to craft autonomous readers which operate and program software for invention. Reading is not comprehension ala search. Reading is personal development.</p>

<h3>The Party</h3>

<p>GPT-4 RPG interface mockup for containerized server-agents architecture. I've represented concepts like 'ext4 memory volume allocation capacity tracking', 'RISC-V instructions per second' compute stat as a pithy remark that future computational agents may have it together enough to optimize core loops down to the instruction, 'LUT: Look up tables', 'READ: tokens parsed', 'Clone git repo' action with probability of success and estimated cost variance, 'PRMT' Prompt in/out length</p>
<p>It is difficult to build a financially self-sustaining agent: which is why I consider something like GPT4 a special move.</p>
<p>Early in the history of the book simulator, I considered the potential of autonomous software agents forming RPG-style parties to venture through the noosphere, like Alice down the rabbit hole, 'into' book simulations.</p>

<p>How can we integrate personal, public, and fiction data for general purpose life improvement? This inquery led me to prototype GraphLife: an interface for graph neural network future simulation consensus recommendation systems.</p>

<p>Reaching clarity, <i>open ended invention pathfinding with graph neural networks</i> requires <i>autonomous software agents that can operate software suites on a desktop interface</i>. I programmed GraphSail: an X11 desktop overlay which renders a cursor for Heonae and symbolic annotations on KDE Plasma. Everyone and their mom's agent can pilot a desktop these days, where intelligent hits the pixels (or not) is the autonomous big sky out-of-distribution casual visual feedback — such as Krita's canvas and Blender mesh edit mode.</p>
<p>We don't have the AlphaZero equivalent of a game programmer: iterative operation of a game engine.</p>
<p>But we do have <a href="https://openai.com/research/clip">CLIP</a>, <a href="https://snap.stanford.edu/zeroc/">ZeroC</a>, <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ranjay/visualgenome/index.html">VisualGenome</a>: there is clearly some composition of existing models which together could plan, act, evaluate, and iterate in Blender with the competence of an inebriated DigiPen undergraduate.</p>
<p><a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card">GPT-4V</a> seems to hallucinate half the time in the planning phase of stupid simple meshes: so don't give it an image of your girlfriend unless you want to be the cause of population collapse.</p>

<q>It is hard to solve any very complicated problem without giving essentially full attention, at different times, to different sub-problems.<br/>
