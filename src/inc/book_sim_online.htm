 <p>Cede me gift you a glimpse, an innocent tease, into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Babylonian</a>-depths of my <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/media/kay72.html">backpack-library</a>: <i>books, open source hardware, and artificial general intelligence</i>.</p>

<p><b>Book Sim</b> is a bespoke  <a href="https://ucldark.com/speaker_22.html">open-ended</a> artificial imagination architected as a reading RPG to facilitate emergence of consciousness through individuation of a virtual civilization.</p>

<p>What is the best thing to read?
    <br/>Hypothesis: Some things are better to read than other things. 
    <br/>SoTA AI can memorize books (no problem since memory is affordable), QA at human level
    <br/>What can't it do in terms of reading books at human level?
    <br/><b>AI lacks imagination</b> (possible to use generative AI to output sensory artifacts, but priority is subjective consciousness: creativity, empathy, etc)
