<p>Dearest reader,<br/>Grata domum. <b>Earth's premiere imagination — a fantasy hardware-research Isekai —</b> invites <b>you</b> to a once-in-a-simulation ascension of open source hardware for whole brain emulation.</p>

 <p>Follow. Cede me gift you a glimpse, an innocent tease, into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">Babylonian</a>-depths of your new <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/media/kay72.html">backpack-library</a>-<a href="https://cbd.cmu.edu/about-us/what-is-automated-science.html">laboratory</a>: <i>books, open source hardware, and artificial general intelligence</i>.</p>

<p>Harken now. Even as you read, these symbols are beset by madness. Should you lose your way, you need only but pursue the light. Do not slow, do not falter, or words will consume all.</p>
<p>We will meet again.</p>
<p><b>Enter <i>Book Sim,</i> The multiplayer reading RPG.</b></p>
<!-- <p><b>Book Sim</b> is a bespoke  <a href="https://ucldark.com/speaker_22.html">open-ended</a> artificial imagination architected as a reading RPG to facilitate emergence of consciousness through individuation of a virtual civilization.</p> -->

<p>What is the best thing to read?
    <br/>Hypothesis: Some things are better to read than other things. 
    <br/>SoTA AI can memorize books (no problem since memory is affordable), QA at human level
    <br/>What can't it do in terms of reading books at human level?
    <br/><b>AI lacks imagination</b> (possible to use generative AI to output sensory artifacts, but priority is subjective consciousness: creativity, empathy, etc)
