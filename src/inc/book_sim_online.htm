<p>My first glimpses of the book simulator emerged in the structure of transcendental daydreams in 2020 while living a neo-primitive life in <a href="https://www.opensourceecology.org/the-story-of-hablab/">HabLab</a>, reading on my reMarkable 2.</p>

<p>the future field of book simulation or fantasy hardware...</p>
<p>(the rest of this article is just open source notes for a rough draft, I am actively advancing this field by writing a NeurIPS paper on the topic.</p>
<p>An RPG to facilitate emergence of consciousness through individuation.</p>
<p>Books as embodied game environments for multi-agent <a href="https://ucldark.com/speaker_22.html">unbounded open-ended learning</a> within a <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/read-to-fight-monsters-using-rl-to-teach-agents-to-generalize-to-new-settings/">'reading RPG'</a> context.</p>

<p>What is the best thing to read?
    <br/>Hypothesis: Some things are better to read than other things. 
    <br/>SoTA AI can memorize books (no problem since memory is affordable), QA at human level
    <br/>What can't it do in terms of reading books at human level?
    <br/><b>AI lacks imagination</b> (possible to use generative AI to output sensory artifacts, but priority is subjective consciousness: creativity, empathy, etc)
