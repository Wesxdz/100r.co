<p><b>WA-01LF</b> is a rationality space opera rationality adaptation of Red Riding Hood: a futuristic AI-alignment anachronism of the Brothers Grimm.</p>
<p>It was loosely inspired by <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/hpmor">HPMOR</a>, rather fortuitously I worked as an AI programmer on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O6Qstncpnc">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, which made this project a natural evolution.</p>
<p>I originally started researching cognitive bias to enhance my cognition because I was <a href="too_many_projects.html">failing to ship</a> anything as an indie dev. I also want a virtual laboratory in which to study consciousness with AGI.</p>
