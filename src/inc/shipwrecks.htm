<p>I have systematically failed many times in my life in ways that have caused harm to my body, my career, my mind, and the people around me.</p> 
<p>I expect failure by default now, and I design to fail safely so I can survive to try again. I am still learning to take care of myself in the process, I will keep trying.</p>
