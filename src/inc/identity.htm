<p><b>Wesxdz</b> is crafting the open hardware infrastructure for every indie game developer on {Earth} to wander, dream, and compute freely.</p>
<p>I'm a digital lovechild, a vegan, a longtermist, a permaculture designer, an indendent researcher. I have a deep and everlasting love for chai, games, computers, and science fiction.</p>
<p>I am currently developing an open source game engine builder called Paphos. I'm implementing the MVP: a visual editor written in Vulkan/libclang/flecs for visually composing C++ systems in realtime. My hypothesis is that nobody has really designed an editor with ECS as a first class citizen above OOP.</p>
