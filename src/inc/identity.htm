<p><b>Wesxdz</b> [wisɛksdiːziː] is crafting the open hardware infrastructure for every indie game developer on {Earth} to wander, dream, and compute freely.</p>
<p>I'm a transhumanist, a digital lovechild, a vegan, <del class="strikethrough">a longtermist</del> a jaded rationalist, a <del class="strikethrough">permaculture</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel_ecosystem" target="_blank">novel ecosystem</a> designer, and an independent AGI researcher. I have a deep and everlasting love for chai, games, computers, and speculative fiction.</p>
<p>I am currently protyping <b>Future Literate</b>: an open source game engine builder. <a href="http://worrydream.com/" target="_blank">1</a><a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Your-Wish-Intro.html" target="_blank">2</a><a href="https://www.krabarchive.com/ralphmag/terrence-mckennaZK.html" target="_blank">3</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">4</a>.</p>
<!-- <p>My working hypothesis is that the most effective path to create a humane economy is to emerge AGI through book simulations, and then bootstrap that into a PASTA RPG that fabricates open source hardware.</p> -->
