<h2>Why your game engine sucks</h2>
<p><i>A rant about the ubiquitous lackluster of modern game engines and my ideas of how to design better tools</i></p>

<p>Three game engines are traveling through a virtual forest when suddenly a 10x programmer appears and promises to grant them each one wish.</p>

<p>Unreal blurts out "I want to be <i>real</i>." Through decades of effort and stacks of Niagara cloth simulated Benjamins, the programmer stoicly grows Unreal's pixely tadpole body into a mannequin with unlimited poly PBR surfaces puppeteered by blueprint templates and editor widgets. Unreal with its aesthetic splendor steps forth from the digital world into the physical and promptly melts from Moravec's paradox.</p>

<p>
    Unity says "I want to be <i>popular</i>." The programmer implements a swiss army knife of lovable prefabricated features and conveniences propheted by an ML powered advertising AI. For a time, Unity prospers and shines with the glow of hopeful youth, eventually it becomes ever greedier, the aloof corporate machine demands more and more of its entrenched following. A mob of solar-powered phone gatcha game players decends on the forest and consumes Unity's blackened soul.

    Godot ponders for a moment in silence and then says "I want to be <i>free</i>"
    The programmer replies, "Great you can help me write my new engine I just started!"
