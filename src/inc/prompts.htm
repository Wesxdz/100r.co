    <p class="prompt">Screenplay of the funniest Monty Python comedy skit ever written. Sci-fi comedy skit about Open Source Hardware.</p>
    <p class="aitext">What do you call a chicken that crosses the road without using a proprietary pedestrian crosswalk indicator?</p>
    <p class="aitext">An open source chicken!</p>
    
    <p class="prompt">Act I.<br/>Two British gentlemen find themselves alone in a hushed, impeccably furnished elevator. The first, a large-bellied man, is swaddled in a sweater adorned with a GNU emblem. His hair is as untamed as a wild bush in a balmy rainforest. His eyes cast a disapproving glare at his companion, a slim, athletic man, outfitted in a crisp black turtleneck, engrossed in his yet-to-be-released iPhone.<br/>


        <p class="aitext">Stallman Parody: (in a stern voice) Good sir, I must inquire as to why you insist on using that devilish device in your hand.<p>

        <p class="aitext">Cook Parody: (with a hint of annoyance) It's called an iPhone, and I happen to like it. It's a beautifully designed piece of technology.</p>

        
        <p class="aitext">Stallman Parody: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I must argue that the true beauty lies in the freedom and transparency of open source hardware and software.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook: (defensive) Freedom? I don't see how locking down the code makes you any less free. Our closed source approach allows us to innovate and maintain the highest standards of quality. I'm not surrendering anything. I just prefer a more streamlined experience.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Stallman: (disagreeing) Your convenient approach might maintain a façade of quality, but at what cost to the user? By not having access to the source code, the user is at the mercy of the corporation and has no control over their own device.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook: (looking up from his phone) Control? All I see is chaos and a lack of innovation. Your Git repositories and arXiv papers might tickle the fancy of some, but they are no match for the magnificence that Apple orchestrates.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Just as the two men are about to continue their argument, a third voice cuts in, seemingly coming from the iPhone itself.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Siri Parody: (cheerful tone) Gentlemen, may I suggest we all take a deep breath and enjoy this lovely elevator ride together?</p>
        <p class="aitext">Stallman Parody: (visibly taken aback) Who in the blazes was that?</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook Parody: (grinning) Ah, that would be Siri, my digital companion.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Stallman Parody: (utterly flabbergasted) Your... your phone just addressed us?</p>
        <p class="aitext">Siri Parody: (teasingly) I understand where you're coming from, Mr. Stallman. But sometimes, it's okay to let go and trust the experts to do their job.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook Parody: (nodding) I trust the team at Apple to always deliver the best.</p>

        <p class="aitext">Their smug amusement is abruptly curtailed as the elevator judders to a halt. The shimmering golden lights flicker ominously before dying out, plunging the elevator into eerie darkness. The air suddenly feels thick and stagnant, redolent with a musky blend of trepidation and expensive cologne.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook: (concerned) Siri, What's going on? Why has the elevator stopped?</p>
        <p class="aitext">The air pressure in this elevator is exactly 758.3 millibars and the average temperature is a comfortable 68°F</p>
        <p class="aitext">Stallman: (smirking in the darkness) Seems the proprietary code in the elevator has left us high and dry.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook: (laughing nervously) That's a stretch, Stallman.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Stallman: (hissing) No, Cook. It's an augury. A grim foretelling of the chaos that comes from leaning too heavily on closed systems.</p>
        <p class="aitext">Cook: (sighing) You're always so melodramatic, Stallman. </p>
        <p class="aitext">(frustrated) This is ridiculous. We need to get out of here.</p>
        <p class="aitext">As Cook concludes his statement, a peculiar shift in the air occurs. The elevator doors labor open with a theatrical creak to unveil a spectacle beyond their wildest imaginations. In the threshold stands a humanoid robot, its metal surface gleaming under the stark neon lights of the elevator, like a sentinel from the future.

            Robot: (in a melodic voice) Welcome, gentlemen. It appears your vertical journey has been momentarily...interrupted. But worry not, the open-source algorithm at the heart of my code detected the anomaly and quickly rectified it.
            
            Stallman: (grinning from ear to ear) And there you have it, Cook! The power of open source!
            
            Cook: (visibly uneasy but intrigued) A small victory, Stallman. But I'm open to...seeing more.
            
            As if on cue, the robot steps aside, revealing an expansive panorama that stretches beyond the elevator. It's as if the doors have opened not merely into a building, but into an entirely new world - a utopia powered by the very principles Stallman has espoused.
            </p>
        
    
    <p class="aitext">Act II.</p>
    <p class="aitext">Why did the software developer cross the playground?<br/> To start a new slide project.</p>

    <p class="prompt">Let's go back and focus on Act 1. I want to get even more personality of the characters, more conflict, more drama, more humor. Make the humor like a collaborative comedy sketch by Monty Python and Bo Burnham, addressing modern issues with deadpan British humor, wild musicals, etc</p>
    <p class="prompt">I like this, but I want Cook to be colder and more haughty in the beginning, only skeptically warming. They should also be greeted at the top of the elevator by an advanced humanoid robot. There should be more description about the smell and feeling of the elevator stopping. The emotions, fear greed anger desparation. Act I should reference git and arXiv, as well as dropping jokes about mind uploading, terraforming mars, and other dramatic hypothetical events</p>
