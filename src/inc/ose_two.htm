<h3>Transplay is my vision for a post-<a href="https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Slide_1">GVCS</a> intentional community</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the midst of an abundant AI summer, fruits cached by the billion, a winter's biting chill strikes me.</p>
<p>It is a helpless gust that lulls the sparse network, a global half-playground disassembled. Deus ex machina capitalism: the open source hardware economy unactualized.</p>
<p>Ephemeral intelligence condensed into the present frame: a village nestled in the heart of the simulation where humans play.</p>
<p>They are in a collective flow, an MMORPG collaboration nurtured diligently by open source environments, robots, and NPCs. Mediated by creative civic algorithms, participants are engaged in open source civilization systems integration in fashion-forward casual wear. Laughing pleasantly at arXiv papers as though they were Calvin and Hobbes comics!</p>
<p>No, not for something as drab as comfort through specialization...</p>
<p>The purpose is not even implicit any longer. The transhumanist <a href="https://www.reversibledestiny.org/books/">crisis ethics</a> held are too safety critical to crumple like a monotone love letter, to risk freefall in foreign markets. Yet, infinite marshmallow-maximizers could not draw forth austerity to meet the measure.</p>
<p>Forking civilization from the GVCS: I want more AI, robots, veganic food, transhumanism, and indie gamedev flavors.</p>
