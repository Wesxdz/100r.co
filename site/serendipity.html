<h1>serendipity</h1><!-- <p><b>Miracles of the simulation</b></p> -->
<p>While I was developing Future Literate at <a href="https://www.industrylab.com/" target="_blank">Industry Lab</a>, I was fortunate to encounter humane technology via Tristan Harris's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oFcGfQ8bWM" target="_blank">A Path to Humane Technology</a>. 
    Pursuing this further by taking the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/course" target="_blank">Foundations of Humane Technology course</a>, I was exposed very early to ideas like considering human nature in my design, prosocial software paradigms like civic technology, and reflecting on values/externalities.</p>
<q>Digital humans</q>
<q>People have a digital form of themselves. People have greater awareness of their physical form and change.</q>
<q>Virtual AI people attempt to influence real people. People create and distribute more realistic deep fakes. People can communicate better. Companies sell peoples' biological data. Virtual politicians run for office. AI represented as virtual avatars in everyday computing. More digital information than ever exists. Wealthier people have greater advantages to improve their well being from this technology and avoid harms with better security. People become more flexible and assume multiple identities. People experience unknown forms of mental illness. People form entirely digital relationships. People simulate what a child with a stranger would look like and how they would behave. Animals and plants also have advanced visual representations. Agriculture technology becomes more sophisticated. More energy is consumed by computers.</q>
<q>Technologists can simulate large numbers of real populations.</q>
