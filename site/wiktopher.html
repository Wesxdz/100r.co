<h2 id='a_novel'>a novel</h2><img src='../media/content/projects/wiktopher_01.jpg' loading='lazy' />
<p><a href='https://wiktopher.ca' target='_blank' class='external'>Wiktopher</a> is a fiction story published online. The story follows two characters, Lupin and Eka, as they navigate the barren lands of the Soronan Desert, seeking food, company and supplies while living day-to-day.</p>

<p>Wiktopher is an attempt at eco-fiction, but because it is so alien we're not sure it befits that label—fantasy eco-fiction then? Themes include environmentalism, cultural identity, food preservation, community, low-tech etc.</p>

<p>The novel has a number of added content (glossary) that permits the reader to learn more of the world and its people.</p>

<h2 id='production'>production</h2>

<p>The story of Wiktopher is an elaboration of a short film Rekka did in 2008 called <b><a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/uno.html" target='_blank'>Uno</a></b>. This project was supposed to expand into a comic, which included many of the Wiktopher characters like Eka, Uno, Zucca, Lupin and Thirteen. Rekka produced a lot of exploratory art for the project, but the comic was never completed.</p>

<p>Rekka began writing a story with those same characters while in Tahihi, <a href='french_polynesia.html' class='local'>french polynesia</a> in 2017. Because of laptop problems (see <a href='tools_ecosystem.html' class='local'>tools ecosystem</a>), drawing using heavy software like Photoshop was near impossible, and so we were forced to consider other hobbies. The story is inspired from our own travels and discoveries. <a href='left.html' class='local'>left</a> was created during this time, to make the writing of this story possible.</p>

<p>This story is written without the use of gender pronouns, using <b>they</b> on occasion, while also employing names of characters, birth city, race, titles, or sometimes acting parts of the body— like, 'the hand pressed on the heart' instead of 'his/her hand pressed on her/his heart'. Rekka chose not to use gendered pronouns to prevent the judgment of a character based on their perceived gender.</p>

<p>The writing of the book was completed on October 2nd 2021, but the road to a truly finished novel is long. We still have corrections to make. We hope to publish a physical copy, which would include a fauna/flora encyclopedia, and to release it as an audio book.</p>
