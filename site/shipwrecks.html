<h1>shipwrecks</h1><q>Life isn’t something where honest people who study hard are always successful. You have to compromise as well!

    <br/><br/>Life was a battle!
    <br/>
<br/><i>-Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, Volume 37 Chapter 1 - Dulmore Fortress's Misfortune</i></q>

<p><b style="font-size:20px">8</b>, in preadolescence: I loved reading and video games. During 3rd grade alone, I devoured over 10,000 pages of young adult fiction. On my Game Boy Advance, I rode my bicycle in the canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red,_Blue,_and_Yellow">Pokemon Yellow</a>.</p>
<p>I was born into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism">religious cult</a>, which complicated my process of individuation. Rather than studying mathematics diligently with private tutors to get into MIT or Stanford, I was grappling with my identity pedagogy from the embryo. 
    After reading the Book of Mormon at the age of <b style="font-size:24px">12</b>, <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2000/10/ye-may-know-the-truth?lang=eng">I prayed to God with a sincere heart, with real intent</a>, having <span class="strikethrough">faith</span> <i>hope</i> in Christ. There was no external response: even if there was, I was already smart enough to understand that coincidence and emotion could never be taken as scientific evidence of a higher power.</p>
<p>Everyone encouraged me to try again, to have <i>faith</i>. I felt cognitive dissonance, I felt like it would be <i>insincere</i> to approach God with a confirmation bias.</p>
<p>Less than a week prior my journey to the divine, I had played Minecraft for the first time. The feeling I had, hiding in a dark cave that first night, listening to the clacking of skeletons outside... It made me feel alive.</p>
<p>God was boring, I wanted to play Minecraft.</p>
<p><b style="font-size:24px">14</b>, I start teaching myself how to create games in <a href="https://www.stencyl.com/">Stencyl</a>.</p>
<p><b style="font-size:24px">15</b>, I read Les Misérables. It was my first encounter with the nuances of morality and the arguments of atheism.</p>
<q><i>The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothing but to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow.<br/>
    <br/>- Les Misérables, Philosophy After Drinking</i></q>
<p>I didn't realize it at the time: but I was a budding rationalist pursing a self-developed ontology in an homogenous environment of missionary fanatics!</p>
<p><b style="font-size:27px">18</b>, I move to Salt Lake City to go to the University of Utah to be an entrepreneur. I read books on linguistics to create a language learning video game - Hola Mundo. I raise a couple thousand dollars; create pixel art and a drag-n-drop prototype.</p>
<p style="color:red">Everything falls apart. My hand is cut by a thick shard of a broken glass carton of milk after unloading grocery palettes from a semi truck to the Sugarhouse Smiths for 6 hours straight. I don't have enough money for tutition for a second semester.</p>
<p style="color:mediumorchid">Broken carton of milk on the floor. First person perspective. Looking at my hand, which is cut by a thick shard of a broken glass. Blood and milk swirling.</p>
    <p>When I encountered <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>, it was like walking into a nostalgic home.</p>
    <p>
Due to a missed email, I once ceeded a payment of $10,000 to the void... The lack of savings from my uncompensated work led me to run out of runway for my startup when I conceded to my weakness of physical pain: surrendering thousands out-of-pocket for decade neglected dental care.
<br/>
<br/>I lost my girlfriend, I lost my housing, I lost my sanity.
<br/>
<br/>I constantly struggle with my mental illnesses, the root of which I self-diagnosed as
<br/>
<q><i>Hyperfocus on psychologically distant world: flow disrupted via low-level construals. Likely caused by Bipolar I.</i></q>
<br/>
<p>I anticipate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication)">Lithium treatment</a> for mood stabilization would substantially improve my well-being, but I refuse to consider it due
to the potential longevity reduction.</p>
<p>Being trapped in poverty due to working on humane technology creates a sense of being the only conscious being in a field of automata.</p>

<br/>I failed to learn Spanish by making a language learning game <a href="hola_mundo.html">Hola Mundo</a><br/>
I have been rejected in many <a href="the_interview.html">Tech Interviews</a><br/>
I failed to solve housing at <a href="ose.html">Open Source Ecology</a><br/>
I start and abandon <a href="too_many_projects.html">too many projects</a>
