<h1>curtains</h1><img src='../media/content/boat_projects/curtains_03.jpg' load='lazy'/>

<p>17.07.21<br> North Saanich BC, Canada.</p>

<p>Our boat has very large windows, and to our dismay, it did not come with any means of attaching curtains.</p>

<p>For a while, we simply attached a bed sheet that we had cut to size. We installed 6 grommets. It helped to diffuse the light, but it had a loose fit, and made the boat appear much narrower than it was. We used a wooden rail on the ceiling to tie it up, but it stopped short of the 3rd window.</p>

<p>This year we decided to make custom curtains for each window, for privacy when we share a dock with others, to block out light on sunny mornings, and as a means of insulating the windows in the winter.</p>

<p>Below is an image featuring the curtain setup we had before:</p>

<p>We used velcro to attach them to the wall. We prefer to avoid making holes in fibreglass if we don't have to.</p>

<p>We made templates of our windows with wax paper (it's what we had, and it works well). The wax paper was the right height, covering the window entirely. We taped it up to the wall, and drew out the shape with a marker. Then, we cut along the line, and labelled each template.</p>

<p>We found curtains at a thrift store to use for this project. We laid out the fabric and placed our template on top, securing the template to the fabric with needles on the corners. We then measured, and marked a 3.5 cm border all around to accommodate both a 1 cm seam (to prevent unravelling) and a 2 cm strip of velcro with extra padding.</p>

<p>We cut the fabric along the line, and folded the seam, laying the sticky strip of velcro (soft side) over the folded seam. We stitched the velcro onto the fabric bottom and top edge using our sewing awl(speedy stitcher). The sides have no velcro, but we stitched the seams.</p>

<p>Then, we added strips of velcro (hook side) to the wall and installed the curtains. Easy!</p>

<p>They are removable, but we prefer to keep them on to avoid having to find a space to store them. We use little wooden clothes pins to secure the rolled up bits of fabric.</p>
