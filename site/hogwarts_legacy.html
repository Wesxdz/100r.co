<p><i>‘Accio Firebolt!’ he shouted. 
	He waited, every fibre of him hoping, praying ... if it hadn’t worked ... if it wasn’t
	coming ... he seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort
	of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure
	and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely ...</i></p>
<p>During my tenure at WB Games/Avalanche, I embarked on an extraordinary ten-month quest as a contract software engineer, where the formidable foes of <b>Hogwarts Legacy</b> became my personal sandbox. 
	My primary responsibilities included shaping the artificial intelligence for key in-game enemies such as the Venomous Tentacula and Chinese Chomping Cabbage. 
	To do this, I leveraged the powerful capabilities of the Unreal Engine to code diverse and engaging behaviors for these characters using behavior trees and other features of the engine and project codebase. 
	I was also instrumental in programming an array of perks and adding depth to the gameplay through the implementation of various bespoke features.
	</p><p>
	I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from, and be inspired by, the visionary Alan Tew, whose passion and expertise in game design greatly influenced my work. 
	It was an incredible experience to be part of a highly skilled and supportive team, where I was able to learn extensively from senior engineers, particularly Kirk Baum and Daren Smith.
	<p>I found myself cast in the role of a dynamic mediator, coordinating with various internal teams and external entities like Gobo. This role required a delicate balance of technical acumen and interpersonal agility, creating a harmony that allowed our collective magic to flourish.
	</p>
	<p>My experience at WB Games/Avalanche has fortified my ability to thrive in a high-pressure, collaborative environment, and sharpened my technical expertise in AAA game development. I am confident that my experience, coupled with my relentless passion for gaming, makes me an invaluable asset to any team looking to push the boundaries of AAA gaming.
