<h1>why your game engine sucks</h1><h2>Why your game engine sucks</h2>
<p><i>A rant about the ubiquitous lackluster of modern game engines and my ideas of how to design better tools</i></p>
<p>Three game engines are traveling through a virtual forest when suddenly a 10x programmer appears and promises to grant them each one wish.</p>
<img src="../media/content/forest_programmer.png" style="height:128px;width:128px;"></img>

<p>Unreal blurts out "I want to be <i>real</i>." Through decades of effort and stacks of Niagara cloth simulated Benjamins, the programmer stoicly grows Unreal's pixely tadpole body into a mannequin with unlimited poly PBR surfaces puppeteered by blueprint templates and editor widgets. Unreal with its aesthetic splendor steps forth from the digital world into the physical and promptly melts from Moravec's paradox.</p>

<p>
    Unity says "I want to be <i>popular</i>." The programmer implements a swiss army knife of lovable prefabricated features and conveniences propheted by an ML powered advertising AI. For a time, Unity prospers and shines with the glow of hopeful youth, eventually it becomes ever greedier, the aloof corporate machine demands more and more of its entrenched following. A mob of solar-powered phone gatcha game players decends on the forest and consumes Unity's blackened soul.

<p>
    Godot ponders for a moment in silence and then says "I want to be <i>free</i>"
    The programmer replies, "Great you can help me write my new engine I just started!"
</p>
<br/>
<p>From my perspective working on AAA and indie projects, it's obvious that games can be created faster and with higher quality given better editor tools.
I see a big part of the problem as <i> fragmentation via multiple discovery duplication of constraint layers</i>... Multiple operating systems, IDEs, a cornicopia of command line tools, asset creation platforms, graphics libraries, rendering interfaces, build and version systems, collaborators (including repo dependencies), and even <b>languages</b>.</p>
<p>I hate to break it to you folks, but we're living in a global cyberspace of scattered towers and wormhaunted libraries of babel (the reality is much worse than that silo analogy you keep hearing about from groupthinkers).</p>
<p>Why are sensory assets engine-agnostic files, while systems and data remain apartheid. You can't write GDScript in Unity, or import your nested prefab as an AActor hierarchy. The amount of wasted effort duplicating functionality is unfathomable to me.</p>

<p>Here are specific examples of actual things that human beings do in game engines anno Domini 2022 that are either inhumane to developers and/or gamers, or massively unproductive and irrational as a result of legacy/poorly designed tooling infrastructure that gained a cumulative advantage.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Property specifiers and gameplay framework in Unreal Engine</li>
    <li>Godot using GDScript by default instead of Python, Lua, or any open source commonly used interoperable programming language</li>
    <li>Unity Collaborate vs git, basically Unity having completely incompetent version control</li>
    <li>Unreal Engine using HLSL by default and cross compiling to GLSL</li>
    <li>OOP being not just a dominant paradigm for game development, but the only constraint viable workflow to ship an indie game in Unreal Engine, Unity, or Godot</li>
</ul>


<p>Here are a couple of solutions I am exploring through research and tool building at Paphos Oneironautics</p>
<ol>
    <li><h3>The Omnibar (lingustically intelligent (see pragmatics) universal spatialtemporal and creation interface)</h3></li>
    <li><h3>Visual ECS manipulation (visual tools whose outputs are simple programs)</h3></li>
</ol>
